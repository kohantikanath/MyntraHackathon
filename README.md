# Hacker-Ramp Hackathon by Myntra
## About the Problem Statement :
The challenge was to create a Gen-Z oriented platform that revamps the regular e-commerce experience.

We aimed to:
- Ensure users visit our app regularly, even when they're not actively shopping.
- Create an engaging shopping experience for new-age audiences.
- Keep trending items available to users.
- Identify current fashion trends.
## Our solution comprises two main flows :
### 1. Curated Theme Sections:
- Designed sections for Anime, Bollywood, Hollywood, K-drama, K-pop, and popular movie merchandise.
- The UI features vibrant posters of current fashion trends, making it easy for users to navigate through their favorite categories and discover the latest styles.
### 2. Interactive Swipe Mode:
- Users can swipe through fashion items, similar to popular dating apps.
- An upward swipe adds the item to the wishlist, a left swipe shows disinterest, and a right swipe expresses interest.
